# Websocket server support in Nuxt3

Nuxt3 is built upon the powerful [nitro server engine](https://nitro.unjs.io/). Which in turn utilizes the [h3 HTTP framework](https://github.com/unjs/h3).

Unfortunately, due to design choices of the underlying `h3` framework, true websocket connections cannot be natively etsablished over the Nuxt3 built-in web server.
This means that the Nuxt3 server and your websocket server need to run on different ports.

# Why are Websocket servers not able to run on the same port?

Simply explained, a websocket connections is a raw socket connection. In order to establish a websocket connection, the browser first sends a several traditional `HTTP GET` and `POST` request.
Then, after making sure the server is ready for it, the connection gets `upgraded` to a socket-based connection. 

Unfortunately this `upgrade` does not work with the Nuxt3 built-in webserver.

# How to put Nuxt3 and websocket server on same port (socket.io example)

You need to create a proxy that forwards websocket requests to the websocket server, e.g. 'http://localhost:4000/socket.io/`.
At the same time it should forward `http://localhost:4000/` and everything else to your Nuxt3 app.

Here is an example how to solve this with three files. All this code can also be put into one Nuxt3 server module if you prefer.

## Example with Nuxt3 + socket.io on the same port

```javascript [proxy.js]
import httpProxy from 'http-proxy';
import http from 'node:http'

const proxySocketIO = httpProxy.createProxyServer({ target: 'http://localhost:3001' });
const proxyNuxt = httpProxy.createProxyServer({ target: 'http://localhost:3000' });

const proxyServer = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  const isSocketIo = req.url.startsWith("/socket.io")
  
  // choose backend depending on url
  if (isSocketIo) {
    proxySocketIO.web(req, res)
  } else {
    proxyNuxt.web(req, res)
  }
})

// upgrade client connection to websocket if requested
proxyServer.on('upgrade', (req, socket, head) => {
  const isSocketIo = req.url.startsWith("/socket.io")

  // choose backend depending on url
  if (isSocketIo) {
    proxySocketIO.ws(req, socket, head)
  } else {
    proxyNuxt.ws(req, socket, head)
  }
})

proxyServer.listen(4000, () => console.log("proxy is listening"))
```

The socket.io server can very easily be created to listen on port `3001`.

```javascript [websocket-server.js]
import { Server } from 'socket.io';

const io = new Server(3001);

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('Connection', socket.id)
});

io.on('connect', (socket) => {
  socket.on("error", (msg) => {
    console.log("socket error", msg)
  })
});
```

Your Nuxt3 will just use the default port `3000`. If you want to make `socket.io` available on the client-side you can create a small plugin.

```javascript [my-nuxt-project/plugins/websocket.client.js]
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';

export default defineNuxtPlugin(async (nuxtApp) => {
    return {
        provide: {
            io: io()
        }
    }
});
```

Now you can use `socket.io` websockets in your templates.


```vue [my-nuxt-project/pages/demo.vue]
<template>
   <h1>Socket.io and Nuxt3 Example</h1>
</template>

<script setup>
const { $io } = useNuxtApp()

onMounted(() => {
  $io.emit("message", "new message sent");
  $io.on("message", (message) => console.log("received backend message", message))
})
</script>
```

Obviously, the `proxy.js` can also be another reverse proxy such as `nginx`. But this is a handy example you can use for example in a docker-compose environment.
